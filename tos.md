# FightCore Terms of Service

This document describes the terms of service of the FightCore bot.
These terms of service may be subject to change as the product itself evolves.

## Usage Agreement

By inviting and using the bot, you agree to the terms and conditions stated within
this document as well as the privacy policy. You have the privilege to add, manage,
remove and use the bot freely, as long as you follow these terms. If any of the terms
are broken, this privilege may be revoked (either temporary or permanently) at any point.

This privilege may also be revoked if you go against one of the following policies:

- [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
- [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy)
- [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)

## Affiliation

The FightCore bot is not affiliated with, supported by, or otherwise relevant to
Discord, MeleeFrameData.com, IKneeData or SmashBoards.
You agree not to suggested to be affiliated with, supported by or otherwise relevant to
FightCore or the FightCore bot. Exceptions may be made for users that contributed
to the FightCore or FightCore bot project in any way. There also may be exceptions
personally provided by myself.

FightCore is not associated with any of the Discord servers that it runs on.

### Forks

There are 2 "official" forks of FightCore that run on different servers.
Melee Online (FightCore#8111) and Melee Newbie Netplay (MeleeFrameData
#9308). These forks are hosted and maintained by FightCore and run the same
code and Docker Container as the main FightCore bot.
These bots are subject to the same privacy policy and terms of service.

Neither FightCore nor the FightCore bot is affiliated, supported by, or in any
other way related to the Melee Online and/or the Melee Newbie Netplay Discord Servers.

Other forks may be asked to shut down if they do not adhere to the standards set
by FightCore or are made with malicious intent.

## Harmful communities or individuals

FightCore reserves the right to remove access to the bot for individuals or
communities that are considered harmful. Bot access may be revoked on an individual
or guild level. The decision process is made by a subsection of the FightCore
contributors with select community influence.
